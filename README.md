🌟 About Me
I'm a Mechanical Engineering BEng graduate (University of Exeter, 2024) turned Python-certified Software Engineer (PCAP, April 2025) with a passion for coding, automation, and problem-solving. With 1+ year of project-based experience, I’ve built RESTful APIs, CLI tools, and automation scripts using Python, Django, and AWS. I’m fueled by curiosity, love tackling LeetCode challenges (50+ solved!), and am eager to grow in energy tech, web development, and cloud computing.
Fun fact: I’m trilingual (English, Cantonese, Mandarin) and a bouldering enthusiast who thrives on collaboration and overcoming challenges—whether in code or on the climbing wall! 🧗‍♂️
